# This shows practical knowledge of C++ classes
## stuff like
1. Referencing
2. Class definiton

Etcetera etcetera 👍

## As usual:
If you have a c++ compiler like g++ then you can do:

```bash
g++ movies.cpp movie.cpp main.cpp -o main
```

to compile
Then: 
```bash
./main
``` 
to run

or you can use the simple shell script I gave in `run.sh`.
In bash just run:
 ```bash
 ./run.sh
 ```
 and youre good to go 👍
